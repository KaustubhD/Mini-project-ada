Steps to run:
1. Clone/Download the repo
2. Open the folder in cygwin/terminal
3. Type ```make```
4. Type ```./test```


**Note**: You don't need to run the *.c* files separately. You get an option for that using above commands.

If in case you still need to run individual files the old fashioned way, **uncomment the main() block** and they'll run fine
